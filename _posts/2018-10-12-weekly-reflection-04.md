this week in computer science we spent some time learning how to update our weekly learning blogs on github. i learned that the blog is supposed to be broken down into 2 parts which are our learning and my learning.our learning is basically when i summarized what the teacher has been teaching the class and my learning is what ive learned in classs and so much more.i really needed the help because i didnt know how to write a descriptive blog. although it sounds like an easy task i barely got work done because of the  learning enviornment my clasmates and i have set. ive taken full responibility by noticing that im one of the kids ressponsible for the rude behavior thats affecting my classmates learnng so i will stop and try my best to be a good exampple
