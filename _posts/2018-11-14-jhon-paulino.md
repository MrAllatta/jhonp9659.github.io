In this week's Computer science class some things i learned is that a contract is a setup you write to get an image. We also learned to pay attention to place holders and defining expressions by summarizing the whole expression. To add on we also learned that sqrt is a function and many more. we also learned that an expression the variable can change and but not the names of the the expression. We also learned that when you are going to write an expression you first have to define it so the computer can recognize what you are trying to get to because sometimes you might think it that the computer is going to define but that doesn't actually happen all the time i also learned that value is not always a color sometimes the function is asking you to write a number instead of a color. A value is a thing that goes together and if you want to turn it into a placeholder you need it to be a the end."book"
