jhon paulino's reflection *6
2018-10-27

this week in computer science we learned about functions ,specifically the fuction "define".we learned that the fuction define has to be follwed by a value for example color and/ or size. one activity that we did is that we figured out our age in seconds day and months with expressions in pair programing 
ive learned alot this week for example how to work with the function define i learned about the defenition and interactions area. i didnt have any struggles this week because it was really easy to focus with my table and i look foward to learning something new next week to improve on my flag project.
