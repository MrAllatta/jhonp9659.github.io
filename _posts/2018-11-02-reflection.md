This week in computer science we learned how to categorize different types of data and some of the basics parts of different types of contracts some different types of data would be strings which are determined by the quotations around it for example "solid" "red".  a number which is an integer for example 5,6,7. and a image which is usually made up with a contract. a contract consist of a name and  domain which would give us an image which is the range. we also learned about a very special contract that will help us alot with the video game project is called (bitmap/url"...") although this function has a pair of quotations its considered an image because thats what it produces. Whithin that pair of quotations (a string) we add a link, not just any link, the link has to be a link to an image  as a class overall i think we did pretty good and our learning enviornment is getting better :computer: :school: :video_game::bowtie:
