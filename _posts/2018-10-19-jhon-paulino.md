This week in computer science my classmates and i learned how to make a function collage.some of these functions include a circle rectangle and a ellipse.this benefits my classmates and i because we have a flag project in which we need to put images on top of eachother in order to get the final piece.we learned that to make functions we need a certain amount of strings and nunbers. strings are words that are quoted for example "solid" and "red". Numbers are the length and width of the function and they DO NOT include quotations.some examples are 25 and 50. since Mr. Allata changed our seats the class has been getting alot more work done.

but besides my class learning ive learned that every function must include a pair of parenthesis. ive also learned that to put images on eachother you need the function "put image". although i did learn alot im still having problems with the number of parenthesis and how to put everything together.thats something i look foward to learning next week in computer science.
