This week in computer science we learned how values and functions differ and their definitions.We were assigned to do an activity in which we defined the function age, name and eye color.The expression that a computer defines is ```“function (___   _value_)”```we also learned that a value stands for something that does not change like the dependent variable in math and science class. We were told to find the missing values in ```(define shape 1 (triangle 50 “solid” “green”)```and the missing values were the numbers to determine the size of the function.We also did a lot of group work which led to us learning about the word modeling and how we can represent the phrase a rocket blasts off .My classmates and i had very different but similar ideas and doing the gallery walk was very eye opening because i didn't know that we had such similar ideas. I personally think that the class is slowly making progress and adding good behavior to the learning environment.:book: :computer: :smile:
